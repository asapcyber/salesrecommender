Sales recommender system for Viavi customers (recommend products based on quarterly sales)

This document describes a Proof of Concept developed by Viavi IT to demonstrate the implementation of a recommender system for Viavi Customers using quarterly sales data. Based on this small-scale implementation it is suggested that a more comprehensive deployment be pursued and launched on Viavi Sales systems and/or customer portals.

# Objective
Take quarterly sales data from customers and use normalized sales quantity as a proxy for product ratings (i.e. the more a customer buys of a given product the higher the product is rated). Then create a recommender system that makes product recommendations for customers when quoting, tracking an opportunity or when a customer searches for a product (like Amazon, Netflix).
